# Collaborative online IDE

## Purpose

The purpose of the application is to offer a space where developers can collaborate in real-time on code. 

The application will have roughly the same features as [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/)

## Features

### Personal space
When users create an account on the application, they get access to a personal space. 
In this personal space is saved all the files they have worked on and all the users they have collaborated with. 
Each time users log in, they see a quick summary of their personal space (mainly their recent files and collaborators). 
- Projects : several files in a folder can be opened on the web editor. 

### Full-fledged code editor
Users have access to a full-fledged code editor with the following features:
- Syntax highlighting
- Code completion
- Code running?
- Drag and drop file to open it
- Upload file to open it
- Download file

### Collaborative code editing
Several users (how many max?) can collaborate on a file together in real-time.
Users can see on their respective editors a cursor showing where their collaborators are in the file. 
Users can invite other users to collaborate together on a file.

### Compiler

### Others
- User can log in with their GitHub account
- User can change their profile picture
