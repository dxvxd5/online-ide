## Future improvements

- Code execution
- Upload file
- File download
- Github integration
- Better support for programming languages
- Following feature during collaboration

## How to run the app locally

#### First install the dependencies

In order to install all the dependencies of the app, you need to execute the command `npm install` in the following directories:

- the project root directory `online-ide`
- the `client` directory
- the `server` directory

#### Next, run the app

Run the entire application (both client and server) by executing the command `npm run dev` in the project root directory `online-ide`.

You can now access the application at `localhost:3000`.

_*PS: You need to have our `.env` file and `jwt issuer keys` in the `server` directory for this to work*_
